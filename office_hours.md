## Office Hours

The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers weekly office hours where CARC users can come for help. Office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.

Office Hours with Prof. Matthew Fricke are on Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00am and Thursdays from 2:00 to 3:00pm MT. In person visits at CARC 1112 or via Zoom are welcome. The Zoom link is [https://unm.zoom.us/j/410709403](https://unm.zoom.us/j/410709403).

Graduate student Kevin Fotso's office hours are on Tuesdays at 11:00 to 11:40am MT via Zoom. The link for Kevin's office hours is https://unm.zoom.us/j/99653166024.

Before you attend please email Matthew at mfricke@unm.edu or Kevin at kfotsotagne@unm.edu to let us know to expect you.

If none of these times are convenient please send an email to help@carc.unm.edu to make an appointment.
